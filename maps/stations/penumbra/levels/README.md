# Penumbra Map Levels

Levels are "group-x-y" where x and y are counting from bottom left to top right.

- The station is on `surface-1-1-1`. The third number is the z-level, as it's
the only multiz area on the surface.
- The station also has two additional z-levels above it, which are
`surface-1-1-2` and `surface-1-1-3`.
