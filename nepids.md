## Summary

The **Dnin-Nepids** are a nomadic species hailing from the outskirts of civilized space. Having taken to the skies after the destruction of their homeworld, they thrive in the fringes of space on the fleets of ark-ships they now call home. Often called 'Moths' due to their superficial resemblence to the Terran insect, the Nepids are a race of natural innovators, engineers, and tinkerers defined by their curious, light-hearted nature.

As a relative newcomer to the galactic community, many spacers have ony heard of them in passing. Early tensions arising from communication failures and differing cultures have gradually eroded into a cautious understanding between them and their closest 'neighbors' in the Orion Confederacy. While more insular groups still dismiss them offhandedly, more enterprising factions have begun to hire migrants as a reliable source of innovation and labor.

## OOC

### Mechanics

Benefits:

- Enhanced senses.
- Environmental adaptivity.
- Enhanced compatibility with augmentations and genemodding.

Drawbacks:

- More frail - direct combat is not advisable.
- Less hardy against certain poisons and diseases.

### Roleplay
- Entirely alien; not co-evolved from other species.
- Low galactic integration; interactions often foreign in both directions for new migrants. First *major* contact in 2490-2500+, though they've existed for longer. You are likely first, or second generation if you reside in Orion space permanently.
- This species is not whitelist-level in terms of obligations / restrictions, and is highly flexible to character concepts.
- This species *tends* to be skittish and the opposite of bloodthirsty and brutish. Where you lack sheer brawn, you gain in agility, dexterity, and adaptivity. Fight smarter, not harder.
- Somewhat light-hearted, with light gremlinry; won't form roving gangs, but probably will play a prank every once in a while.
- Superstitious. Religions around stars and ships are common amongst the religious, though less common nowadays.
- Majority are born in space and fit naturally into space, though nothing stops them from adapting to a planet.

## Identity

The Dnin-Nepids are an inherently matriarchal society. The majority of them stick fast to traditional practices; While the more unwieldly tendencies have practically evaporated in the advent of technological progress, many traits of their culture have been adapted throughout their developments, rather than cycled out over time.

### Names

The Dnin-Nepids is a matriarchal society, with family names often passed through maternal lineages. 

%TODO% do we really want sumerian names
> suggest using finnish/icelandic names because they sound cooler + i said so[name=Kraseo]

- OOC: Their names are generally Sumerian-adjacent sounding, for pure-bloods born in the fleet. 
- Traditionally, a clan-name denoted origins, rarely changed throughout life other than when one fully emigrates. Obviously impractical to continue after such primitive groupings gave way to city-states, much less after their ascent to the stars, it is now far more common to have a phrase denoting where you are from.
- Immigrants sometimes change their name to something more easily used in common galactic tongues. Those born outside of the arkships of the fleet often have partial names entirely.
- Most purebloods consider it insulting to adopt origin-phrases for foreign constructs. You would likely be laughed out of town if you claimed to be of a megacorporation's ship, both due to cultural reasons, and due to foreign ships not having quite the same ring to it.

Given how long names are a mouthful and are usually annoying to pronounce - in native language, let alone when translated to languages like Common, full name-phrases are usually only used during first-greetings and during formalities. It is common to address aonther by the closest word to their profession followed by their first name.

### Luinimma

The primary language of the Dnin-Nepids, Luinimma is a fast vocalization constituted of what can be best described as a series of chitters, with intersparsed clicks and chirps. It is often very hard for foreigners to understand, let alone vocalize - the nature stemming from some specific phonemes that are nearly impossible to vocalize without the right biology. 

The other way around is not quite so debilitating, however. Dnin-Nepids often suffer from some tics in their vocalizations when first learning to speak other languages, but are otherwise perfectly able to - with a good few years of practice.

It is not unheard of for Dnin-Nepids that are a hybrid of another species to lose the vocal functions required to speak their language to a native's degree. While augmentations to supplement such deficiencies do exist, such individuals are often looked down upon by more traditional purists.

Distinct from some other languages like Sol Common, it is *not* a combined amalgamation of regional, precursor languages - while sentence structures, fragments, words, and even phenomes have drifted over time, the overall vocalization patterns remain remarkably consistent across the Fleet.

## Physicality

The Dnin-Nepids derive many of their physical characteristics from the uniqueness of their environment. The highly polar nature of their former planet, %plt%, coupled with the contrast of its nearly Gaia-like environment, resulted in the evolution of adaptivity without the usual complement of aggression.

Dnin-Nepids look physically insectoid, with pure-bloods having many traits associated with Terran *moths*:

- Their bodies are slim and lightweight, with efficient bones and musculature.
- Heights differ by specimen, with reported heights being from a miniscule 120cm (4'0") to a whopping 203cm (6'8"). Most tend towards the midway, being on average almost on-par if not slightly shorter than Humans.
- Their bodies are covered with a variable layer of fuzz, with the areas around and below their necks having the most - this trait being the most responsible for their 'moth' appearance if excluding their wings.
- Purebloods often do not have long hair - if they have 'hair' at all. A light layer of fuzz instead of hair is far more commonplace.
- They have two antennae on their heads; they're very useful for sensing wind motion, and some can even move them on demand. While relatively fragile, they can naturally regrow them over a week or two.
- They are *still* mammallian despite their looks, with the capability of maintaining their body temperature. Their wings are very helpful in this regard in terms of heat dissipation, though they can manage without them.
- Their hands and feet are mostly humanoid, and are quite nimble - though they tend to have subtly talon-like extensions rather than the thin, soft fingernails of Humans.

Dnin-Nepids are one of the only naturally flying species - though more in theory than practice. Their wings allow them efficient flight in environments similar to their late homeworld. In modern times, however, confined to the cramped spaces of voidcraft, Dnin-Nepids often hide their wings behind heavy, protective cloaks. The more cynical view it as a permanent reminder of what they lost; void-born Dnin-Nepids never quite develop the instincts required for flight, and often need to acclimate for months, or even years to learn to fly again.

### Adaptations

The polar nature of %plt% have branched the Dnin-Nepids into two distinct, and rather vivid sets of phenotypes. While 'hybrids' and all sorts of mutations typical of such a split do exist, most Dnin-Nepids tend towards being adapted for the side of the planet they're on. This often results in formations of features like:
- Coloration: Dnin-Nepids often develop lighter or darker features based on which side of the planet they're on. This is likely both for camoufladge, as well as for thermodynamics.
- Attraction: Dnin-Nepids are naturally curious towards the *opposite* color scheme; light-adapted Dnin-Nepids tend to favor natural shade, and dark-adapted Dnin-Nepids are sensitive to light.
- Senses: Dark-adapted Dnin-Nepids have good night vision and spatial awareness, while light-adapted ones have sharper vision and endurance, even in direct sunlight.
- Wings: Light-adapted Dnin-Nepids often have colorful, complicated wing patterns, while their dark-adapted brethren tend towards simpler ones.

### Trivia

- A Dnin-Nepid's wings are surprisingly dextrous, sporting a calcium-based lattice underneath the top layer of thin, protective hair. It is theorized that this helps mitigate the constant shock experienced by their wings when carrying the weight of a full mammal.
- Dnin-Nepids have a highly varied metabolism - consuming very little energy when in perfect conditions, and eating a *lot* when forced to undertake constant, strenuous activity, to endure difficult temperature differentials, or when allowed to fly.
- Adaptations towards light and dark environments are not just a genetic factor; while it is usually the deciding component, it is not uncommon for one to differentiate their colorations and adaptations after birth based on what environment they were raised in. In some rare and extreme cases, one can even partially shift colorations later in life.
- While very rare, dark-adapted Dnin-Nepids sometimes have softly reflective patterns on their wings and eyes, sort of like Terran cats; Even rarer still, some outright have a mild bioluminescene to various parts of their body.

## Locality

### %sys%

The stellar origin of the Dnin-Nepids, %sys% consists of 7 planets orbiting a pair of binary, class-G stars. A wide, yet sparse ring of asteroids divides the system past the fifth planet. In modern times, the system sees much traffic - usually from archeologists of the selfsame species that once inhabited it, as well as from some sparse mining operations.

The usual penchant of Dnin-Nepids to live on a dagger's edge seemed to be inherited from this very system; Given the eccentricity of %sys%-A and %sys%-B's orbits, most of the planets in the system are either dark, lifeless (and resource-rich) rocks, or planets with scorching atmospheres. Only %plt% escaped this fate, being placed within the narrow habitable zone of %sys%.

#### Planets

%TODO%

- %sys%-1 - %TODO%: A scorched world. Its proximity to the binary stars has long resulted in its sterilization. The atmosphere is practically non-existant, and the surface is constantly baked with deadly radiation.
- %sys%-2 - %TODO%: A rocky world much like the first planet, albeit with far less resources - skipped over by even mining groups for this reason.
- %sys%-3 - %plt%: The only planet that natively supported sapient life. Earth-like composition, with elevated amounts of noble gasses in the atmosphere and slightly lowered gravity. Tidally locked, with a narrow "habitable" band of the planet separating the day and night sides.
- %sys%-4 - %TODO%: An icy world - literally. There is much debate as to if this planet could have been inhabitable, given the frozen rivers that run through its land - what's for certain is its crucial role as a staging point for early, pre-FTL excursions by the Dnin-Nepids.
- %sys%-5 - %TODO%: Though lacking in any valuable resources, this planet does sport the closest proximity to the asteroid belts of %sys%. Early colonization of this world was crucial to the Dnin-Nepids' survival, allowing 'primitive' mining operations a place to call home.
- %sys%-6 - %TODO%: The shield of the system. A gigantic world made out of dense, hot gases - no doubt having spared many inner planets from a battering with its immense gravitational well, and near-perfect circular orbit.
- %sys%-7 - %TODO%: A barren tomb. Too far for light to reach, it has naught much more than gigantic craters from the days of %sys%'s formation. A few observational outposts ran by Dnin-Nepids dot the landscape in modern times, kept lit by ship drives converted for planetary operation - it stands forever vigil as the last watch of their former home.

## Technology

Dnin-Nepids often focus on adaptivity first, reliability second, and elegance *last*. Reflected in their voidcraft, devices, and other machinations, their handiwork is best described as 'healthily optimistic', and worst described as 'enigmatically infeasible'. While most of their technology contain some level of standardization - agreed upon early after their exodus with the impending threat of technological fragmentation - distinct sub-fleets often have their own take on things. At times, efficiency seemed to outweigh *sanity*, with infrastructure being highly pragmatic, as well as highly *headache-inducing* to decipher and unravel. 

- With so many engineers in their midst, the technology of the Fleet is as diverse as it is unwieldly. There are often a half dozen ways to go about something within a cluster of arks alone. Dnin-Nepids often suffer from a good few weeks of being utterly out of place when taking abode on an unfamiliar ship.
- The only saving grace is the system of standards established, as well as a strict adherence to universal compatibility for **anything** relating to ship architecture. Interchangable designs and core systems were crucial for their early expansion - allowing for reliable access to repairs without having to negotiate something as simple as the capacity of a power interconnect.

### Voidcraft

As a nomadic people, spacefaring technologies are the crown jewel of the Dnin-Nepids' technological progression. While one may see anything from a sleek, star-liner of the future to what's seemingly a station made out of messy rectangular prisms on the exterior, Dnin-Nepid ships are often highly optimized internally.

- Ships often have different design methodologies depending on their purpose. While a proper flagship may have many spaceious interior areas for usage by its inhabitants, a streamlined exploration cruiser may have relatively cramped interiors - with the majority of passageways not more than 5-6 meters tall.
	- Artificial gravity technology tend to be less efficient on Dnin-Nepid ships than what is commonly used among the wider galaxy. Inhabitants can expect only a 75-85% replication of Earth-like gravity in most cases.
	- Almost every paradigm of vessel contains living space and relevant facilities to foster a sizeable community. While dedicated ark-ships exist, they are often the flagships of their fleet-groups - the space-faring equivalent to a metropolis as opposed to urban cities.
- As a fully space-faring race, Dnin-Nepid voidcraft have a focal emphasis on speed and maneuverability.
	- Hull plating is often relatively light on the exterior. Ships rely on a tough internal exoskeleton to transfer forces across the entire vessel.
	- Shielding is preferable to armoring, even on military and scouting vessels. This emphasis has allowed the Nepids to create shielding technology *partially* resistant to impulses of charged particles, reducing the vulnerability they would otherwise suffer from this narrow-minded focus.
- Every ship other than the smallest shuttles - often landing vehicles for usage when space or conditions do not permit a full cruiser - are fitted with high-performance sublight and lightspeed transit drives.
	- Dnin-Nepid ships primarily use tachyon-flux drives for interplanetary travel. The receivers are often spanning entire regions of the ship, built directly into the superstructure and linked to reactor connections. Ships can often vector at nearly a moment's notice.
	- Sublight thrust is generally achieved with a direct conduit to the ship's primary power source. This comes with advantages and disadvantages - while *fast*, this is generally not considered to be as reliable as hybrid options.
	- More experimental ships often contain relatively primitive (in comparison to Nanotrasen) bluespace drives. Useful for short-distance translations, they are often unable to perform the necessary path calculations, as well as field maintenance, required for long-distance travel.
- As a heavily nomadic species, land-based technologies have relatively stagnated under the presiding technological focus. The guiding principle for handling a sticky situation remains to use and abuse the refined drive systems powering their ships - able to easily evade and outmaneuver their opponents.
	- Rather comedically, it remains heard of for the rare Dnin-Nepid outpost to have problems stemming from aggressive fauna native to a planet - heavy land infrastructure has simply fallen out of favor after centuries spent in space.

### Energistics

A quick transition from the reliance upon terrestrial power sources has demanded an obsession towards the development of compact power sources nearly on-par with ship technologies. Given the relative lack of combustion capabilities in space - with relatively limited air supplies, not to mention organic material - most technologies heavily utilize various forms of energy fields.

- Linear motors utilizing electromagnetics are extremely common, embedded into a wide variety of everyday tools. Mechanical devices almost always use this as an actuation method
- Combustion-based vehicles are considered antiques, often displayed to trainee engineers during instruction as a relic of the past.
- Armaments used are primarily electromagnetic, from the simplest of handheld weapons to the biggest of ship-mounted hardpoints. This primarily stems from both the early lack of viable, high-impulse motors for self-propelled rounds, as well as the maneuverability of scout craft.
- While their artificial gravity is relatively primitive compared to other species, Dnin-Nepid installations often contain magnetic shields protecting their occupants from a variety of interstellar hazards - spurred on by the lessons learned on their late homeworld.

### Augmentations

As a species evolved to be relatively lacking in brawn compared to others, the Dnin-Nepids have long devised mechanical assistance for what they lack in sheer strength. While creativity is a point of pride for them, a steel beam weighing a few hundred pounds needing to be installed in a shipyard cares little for mental prowess. Exoskeletons powered off wireless induction quickly led to the first powered voidsuits in the ascent to the stars - followed by increasingly complex cybernetics churned out by scores of researchers wishing to leave their mark on synthetic evolution. This is, however, not without opposition.

- Almost every engineer on a post-Exodus arkship has access to technologies that greatly improve their industrial capabilities. This can range from powered spacesuits capable of boosting one's lift by a few tens of pounds, all the way to the rare usage of fully prosthetic limbs and endoskeletons.
- Augmentations often operate in synchronicity with the user it was designed for, as well as their environment. Wireless power distribution systems are wired into most common places on a ship to maintain low-power implants. Specific implants are often adapted to their user's preferences, with more advanced ones adjusting to their user's style over time without intervention.
- While the utilization of external equipment is a constant for the species, the overall usage of prosthetics and cybernetics are at best, subject to debate. More conservative arkships and cultures tend to shun the elective usage of cybernetics - considering them to unacceptably blend the line between what is natural, and what is *created*.

### Synthetics

Synthetic life is nothing new to the Dnin-Nepids. The quick discovery of cohesive, self-sustaining networks led to an explosion of artificial intelligence. Eager technologists raced each other to be the first to fabricate a *created* lifeform. Unlike most corporations, these early synthetics were primarily researched, rather than put to work. While neural networks were common - as much of an inaccurate, *rough* commodity as they were - true synthetics were few in number at first. The processes required to fabricate positronic cores at the precisions required for their purpose were restricted to the most enigmatic of institutions. Early synthetic models were slow to take off, slow to evolve, and slow to *think*. As much of a curiosity as they were, they were relatively neglected compared to the zeal for augmentations and technologies that improve the *self*.

With the discovery of lightspeed transit and the dispatch of the first scouting vessels, however, the race for sapient constructs re-ignited with far higher stakes. Rather than the mere goal of research into the artifice of synthetics itself, the need for avatars that could weather the hostile conditions of space, and forge out ahead where *people* could not, arose. Longevity of positronic cores skyrocketed from months, to years, until the first seemingly stable personalities arose. A stark contrast to the mass-produced, pre-imprinted positronics of a corporation, Dnin-Nepid synthetics were built to act in tandem with their creators, rather than to work *for* their creators.

#### Nomenclature

Created to be an extension of their host vessels and their technicians and artisans, Dnin-Nepid synthetics share a similar, but divergent naming scheme as the one often used to name arkships and shuttlecraft.

- Synthetics are always identified in domain by their originating ship.
    - For the outlying cases where one is not made onboard a ship, the name of the planet or the stellar system is also acceptable.
- Synthetics are presecribed a **lineage and discriminator** for identification within that ship's databases. This is necessitated due to the immense amount of data collected by synthetics throughout their lives - identifying them by their given names is simply infeasible at scale
    - This part of their 'name' is never used as their name, and using it as such outside of diagnostics is seen as mildly derogatory.
    - Example: `AVX-299`
- Synthetics have a **given name** often comprised of a phrase corrosponding to an action or concept. This is usually somewhat different from voidcraft nomenclature, to avoid *too* much confusion. These are also usually quite abstract in nature.
    - Examples include:
    - Level Ground
    - Unparalleled Innocence
    - Five Pebbles
    - Six Blue Stars
    - Fizzling Accretion Disk
    - Little Significant Action
    - Countless Stars
    - No Significant Harassment
    - Light of Numerous Aspects
    - Hale Complexity
- In totality, an example of a full name for a synthetic might be `[name], of the [ship]` --> `Light of Numerous Aspects, of the Spirited to Stars`. 
- Much like their creators, synthetics whom are fully integrated into other societies may adopt other names, or even shortened monikers.

#### Form

Synthetics are made for, and 

#### Function

- Synthetics often choose their own names, and are addressed by such, in combination with their role. These names are often highly varied - influenced by the specific tendencies of their creators.
    - Their technical designations are shockingly similar in structure to those of common galactic corporations, likely due to the relative efficiency of alphanumeric designations. Most synthetics have a designation with a lineage and discriminator. Such designations are local to the ark-fleet of origin. Example: AVX-511.
- A lineage of positronics indicate the presence of similar, or even the exact same templates used in initialization. Unlike most modern corporations, however, the vast majority of Dnin-Nepid arkships opt to stop tuning their templates far before the level necessary for a synthetic able to perform complex tasks like engineering and colonization out of the box.
    - It isn't uncommon for freshly created positronics to know no more than Luinimma, as well as any basic concepts pre-programmed in. Synthetics are initially tuned to *understand* their world and the people around them, as opposed to manipulate the world and perform a specific task.
- Most synthetics are first initialized as part of a batch in a laboratory, and then allowed to assimilate into the populace and observe their intended functions directly from those performing it. The lack of narrowly tuned parameters result in a synthetic being able to absorb vast amounts of information from their surroundings - rapidly becoming as proficient, or even more efficient than the organic that they shadow within a short period of time.
    - Synthetics often, for better or worse, exhibit this malleability throughout their lifespans, allowing even dated units to re-adapt to their circumstances - the exact opposite of most corporate synthetics made in Human space.
- It is considered **strictly** taboo to permanently enslave synthetics, or to produce them for the explicit purpose of warfare. Such usages are only rumored from rogue arkships and fleet-groups.

## Relations

Dnin-Nepids are a newcomer to the galaxy at large. Due to their late integration and other troubles common with meeting a rather skittish species for the first time, views towards them in general tend to be dismissive at best, with some initial tensions - and occasional hostilities - to be expected. Regardless, individual Dnin-Nepids have carved their way into the galaxy over the past few decades, whether it may be to drift from place to place as travelers, or to join the crew of one of the varied megacorporations.

### Governments

The recognition of the Dnin-Nepids as a galactic power is tenacious as best, due to their lacking of a stationary, central government. Much of the status quo came from the fact that they are simply to far to be of care to anyone but the Orion Confederacy. While communications have improved over the years, the only official agreements reached tend to be for allowing employment and emigation - and the usual promises of non-aggression.

Frontier governments and settler groups, however, vary widely in their outward dispositions towards the Dnin-Nepids. As the ones who suffered the brunt of tense, initial contact - with Nepid scouting and excursion ships often attempting to fly under the radar - they often require incoming ships to agree to be monitored for the duration of their transit, or sometimes abide by stringent protocols.
### Megacorporations

While all megacorporations tend to be heavily utilitarian and opportunistic, they nonetheless view the introduction of a new species differently. The brunt of Dnin-Nepids' contact with stellar corporations comprise of sightings on bordering space - given the penchant of the latter to dispatch frequent scouts in the search of resources. Ironically, the corporations - Nanotrasen included - with more risk of having 'border problems' with the Dnin-Nepids (albeit in the far future) tend to be more friendly - after all, who would turn down the employment of a shipwright when competing in space?

More insular corporations, however, may think quite differently of the Dnin-Nepids. While the galaxy is, theoretically, civilized, and hastily scribbled agreements require the cordial treatment of civillian traffic, Dnin-Nepids often suffer from hostile xenophobia in less forwards regions.

## Miscellaneous / Trivia 

- Given Dnin-Nepids's tendency of having their voidcraft be a point of pride, they have been known to challenge other space-borne species, like the Vox, to drag races - usually to settle a heated debate. This is, however, rarely seen modern day, due to more ~~boring~~ reasonable species regarding the practice as 'reckless' and 'uncivilized'.
