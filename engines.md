Core: ejectable matter-antimatter machine that jumpstarts the fusion process to instantly sustainable levels when you are ready to start the reactor. Fusion plasma contained in electromagnetic fields, the device making it has to be kept cooled down to function. Over a certain temperature they'll begin to degrade, causing fusion plasma to escape and damage the core. If it gets too damaged the stored antimatter would cause a large explosion.

Fuel: Would be fueled by machines that are fed fusion materials and can be adjusted to then pump this into the fusion plasma at certain rates depending on how much energy you want to produce. Different reactions produce more power at higher temperatures and need a minimum temperature to begin reacting at all. Starting reactions would be deuterium-deuterium, deuterium-He3, and deuterium-tritium like the RUST uses now. Mid-tier ones could move on to using materials like lithium and boron, while the end-game would be proton-proton fusion like what occurs in the core of a star. 

Cooling: Electromagnetic fields carry metal dust into space to cool off, and then bring it back into the ship in a loop. Yes, I have been playing a bit too much Terra Invicta lately and am stealing this idea from them. Better parts equals better electromagnetic fields that can hold more resources, and more exotic materials radiate heat better. Losing power would result in a steady loss of resources over time as it drifts off into space out of range. 

Mechanics: The hotter the reaction gets the more waste heat you need to deal with, but the more/hotter plasma you'll generate for the EPS network, and the more efficient the reactions you can use become, which then creates more heat you need to deal with. Once you achieve proton-proton fusion you'd be able to sustain it with relatively little resources due to how efficient the reaction is. Maybe integrate the crypto miner into the reactor to turn excess plasma into even more heat for points


Fol: 
Sorry but going to textwall for a suggestion. Since we already have R-UST as a well-established tokamak/magnetic confinement fusion engine, I feel like we should have an inertial confinement engine. This is going to be out of order to make (some) sense.
For "powering" it, you'd use lasers (they're already absurdly powerful in-universe anyways). I think mechanics here are pretty blank slate, how much flash-lamp/amplifier/mirrors/etc there needs to be, or the geometry of the engine, but I will point out this would make the main engine require a base amount of power stored to even start running (backup engine?). Would probably be the kind of thing you set up carefully, check well, and then flip on and hopefully don't watch it cut holes into the walls (rather than a slow-burn start of most engines that heat up etc.).
Now if we just did ICF that would be pretty robust and realistic etc but then doesn't meet the criteria (:meowsad:), so my suggestion is to give it a core mcguffin. Instead of shooting a fuel pellet in flight, give it a final lens/reflector/giant holhraum "Core" that the lasers fire into, and into which the fuel also goes, and out of which comes the Supercharged Plasma, and we just don't consider the specific physics and geometry of how you're actually compressing the fuel inside of it.
Obviously this would be the thing you eject and I guess we can assume it holds the fusing gas inside it for some time, so even if the lasers can be cut off instantaneously, it would still be hot and fusing for some as-of-now-indeterminate amount of time. You'd probably also want to focus the cooling on this, though maybe the big person-sized laser equipment should also get cooling, I don't know.
Finally, this could run continuously, since we're ignoring the critical design consideration of ICF and keeping aesthetics, but for the sake of such aesthetics I would argue the lasers be pulsed and the reaction constant. (Like emitter for the SM)
I think in that form, it should hit the goals:
You can have a default easy textbook configuration that's probably already set up and only needs securing the parts and putting the fuel Core and piping fuel into to run.
Expandable since in my mind you'd have some kind of puzzle or mechanic with the different laser stages/machines to either make it more energy efficient to run, or safer, or more powerful, etc?
Dangerous, in both a, should take some thought to change the setup and keep it able to be run safely (see: stray lasers, or just explode too much fuel at once on startup, or too little and it can't sustain it at all and just wastes your laser power, etc), and also should be dangerous in-operation if operated carelessly (core melts, etc).
Variable fuel level/power level. Almost inherent to using a thing that takes power to start, there would be a minimum power to run, but there's probably a window of energies you could run it at, with that window probably getting taller and more rewarding if (to go back to #2) expanded.
It needs the core mcguffin to become an ejectable concept, but, it is.
Last requirement also met as you just crush the fuel into a fusion plasma, there needs be no electricity generated.
