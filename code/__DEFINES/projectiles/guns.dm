//Gun loading types
#define SINGLE_CASING 	1	//The gun only accepts ammo_casings. ammo_magazines should never have this as their mag_type.
#define SPEEDLOADER 	2	//Transfers casings from the mag to the gun when used.
#define MAGAZINE 		4	//The magazine item itself goes inside the gun

#define HOLD_CASINGS	0 //do not do anything after firing. Manual action, like pump shotguns, or guns that want to define custom behaviour
#define EJECT_CASINGS	1 //drop spent casings on the ground after firing
#define CYCLE_CASINGS 	2 //experimental: cycle casings, like a revolver. Also works for multibarrelled guns
