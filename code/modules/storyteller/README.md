# Storyteller

The heavily in-dev work-in-progress automated game-mastering system for Citadel RP.

## Requirements

- Overmap is required, even if there's only one entity.
  - The entire backend depends on the overmap for distancing; if you're doing a (wink wink) hellish grimdark medieval server or something, just don't allow overmap access and have it be a 1x1 overmap with one entity, lol.
