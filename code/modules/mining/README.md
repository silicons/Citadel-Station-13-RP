# Mining Module

The Citadel RP mining module consists of two parts

- horizontal - breaking across/through caves.
- vertical - drilling into the ground

horizontal is referred to as 'excavation'
vertical is referred to as 'drilling'

.. which is somewhat dumb when both mean the same thing, but, we need a lexicon and
i didn't want to call it 'spelunking'.
