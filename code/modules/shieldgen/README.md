# Shieldgen Module

This is the **world shield generation feature module.**

What **is not** in here:

- Overmap 'entity shields' ; ergo FTL-like shields that stop projectiles before they even enter the physical level.
- Specialized shields projecting only to one entity or something like that.

What **is** in here:

- Any shield affecting a swathe of turfs.
- Helpers for such.

This is kind of a weird module as not everything is interconnected, but it is what it is, as they say.
